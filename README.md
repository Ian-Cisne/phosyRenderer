# phosyRenderer
Ray-traicing-based renderer in C++ for Phosy.

---
This is a project whose intension is to follow [Ray-Traicing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/=) book series and being part of the project [phosy](https://github.com/Ian-Cisne/phosy).

I tried to use some features from C++11 to C++17.
